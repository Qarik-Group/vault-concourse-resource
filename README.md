* `prefix`: *Optional.* Prefix to use for the output path in vault.
* `secret_maps`: *Optional* List of secrets to copy and where to put them. Each secret_map has a source, dest and keys field. source is the source of the existing secret to copy, including the path. source is required. dest is where to copy the secret to. dest is optional. keys is a list of which json keys to copy. keys is optional. a key can either be a single string, in which case it retains that key name, or it can be a key/value pair, to specify the existing key name and the renamed key name.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* golang is *required* - version 1.15.x or higher is required.
* docker is *required* - version 17.05.x or higher is required.
* make is *required* - version 4.1 of GNU make is tested.

### Running the tests

The Makefile includes a `test` target, and tests are also run inside the Docker build.

Run the tests with the following command:

```sh
make test
```

### Building and publishing the image

The Makefile includes targets for building and publishing the docker image. Each of these
takes an optional `VERSION` argument, which will tag and/or push the docker image with
the given version.

```sh
make VERSION=1.2.3
make publish VERSION=1.2.3
```
